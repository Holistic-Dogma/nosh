# Nosh

## Sample Branch - A small web app for encrypted pastes

This is a monorepo based on my own `nosh` bun based monorepo project [here](https://github.com/Holistic-Dogma/nosh/blob/main/README.md) (text is also pasted below). This is the nightly branch, and has the application sample built in as well for testing; platform updates will be extracted and pushed separately to the above.

If you've downloaded this without installing bun, then make sure
you have the following set up:

1. Install 'direnv'; I don't have a non-intrusive way to install this package yet, so please install it manually. Alternately, you can `source .envrc` to load the environment variables. (I do have a script for force-install of direnv, but would prefer to stay out of the user's HOME directory when possible).

2. Right now I'm just trying to get clean feature parity with the older apps. We'll get there.

# Nosh: From The Official Repo

## A Paranoid Monorepo

Nosh intends to build a npm-compatible workspace based monorepo, with support for multiple
projects, by providing:

1. A strong suite of zsh tools, added "invisibly" (upon install of direnv).
2. Bun.sh and React; does not use other frameworks, and uses as few packages as possible.

### Why?

Since both d3.js and @mui have been found to have... metrics gathering software, Nosh is
designed to be encryption first. Yes, I do intend to have extensive browserside logging;
yes, I intend to use the w3/mdn structure rather than react wherever possible; but the goal
is to build a simple, rapid application platform that allows for rapid tooling in other
languages which fit seamlessly into the ecosystem.

### History

In the first half of 2024, I found myself migrating a company's Preact/Express setup to
Nx/Next.js. I found myself very impressed with Nx - not quite so much with Next. After
discovering Deno and Bun, I've decided to build my next toolkit in Bun, conforming to
browser standards (for which react has "workarounds"), as many home-grown, no-spyware
tools as possible, and build an ecosystem which moves the world towards what I like to call

## The better Web3

- Every day I open up a browser
- And I do a google search
- And every page I visit gathers metrics on me
- And *threatens* me when I write scripts that shut them all down.

Ideally, distributed DNS becomes an option;
*	Individual works (songs, artwork, nfts, plugins, software) are all created individually;
* Those whose skill lies in curating and discovering wonderful things can find these
*	Because every creator is also a broadcaster
* Every curator is like an interior designer


Doesn't it seem like those days when you could buy "six albums for 1 cent" just
to be stuck in a contract with one of the big recording studios is back again,
just more inescapable?



* We add aria tags to browsers to extend our XML based systems towards the multisensory experience the internet will one day become;
* The browser is window shopping.
* Visiting a site and seeing endless ads for something you saw is intrusive and unwanted.


I may not succeed;
  but if I can, I will murder the browser.
