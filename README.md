# Nosh

## Sample Branch - A small web app for encrypted pastes

This is a monorepo based on the `nosh` bun based monorepo project.
If you've downloaded this without installing bun, then make sure
you have the following set up:

1. Install 'direnv'; I don't have a non-intrusive way to install this package yet, so please install it manually. Alternately, you can `source .envrc` to load the environment variables.

2. Right now I'm just trying to get clean feature parity with the old
apps. We'll get there.
