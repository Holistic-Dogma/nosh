# Nosh

## A Paranoid Monorepo

Nosh intends to build a npm-compatible workspace based monorepo, with support for multiple
projects, by providing:

1. A strong suite of zsh tools, added "invisibly" (upon install of direnv).
2. Bun.sh and React; does not use other frameworks, and uses as few packages as possible.

### Why?

Since both d3.js and @mui have been found to have... metrics gathering software, Nosh is
designed to be encryption first. Yes, I do intend to have extensive browserside logging;
yes, I intend to use the w3/mdn structure rather than react wherever possible; but the goal
is to build a simple, rapid application platform that allows for rapid tooling in other
languages which fit seamlessly into the ecosystem.

### History

In the first half of 2024, I found myself migrating a company's Preact/Express setup to
Nx/Next.js. I found myself very impressed with Nx - not quite so much with Next. After
discovering Deno and Bun, I've decided to build my next toolkit in Bun, conforming to
browser standards (for which react has "workarounds"), as many home-grown, no-spyware
tools as possible, and build an ecosystem which moves the world towards what I like to call

## The better Web3

Every day I open up a browser
And I do a google search
And every page I visit gathers metrics on me
And *threatens* me when I write scripts that shut them all down.

Ideally, distributed DNS becomes an option;
	Individual works (songs, artwork, nfts, plugins, software) are all created individually;
Those whose skill lies in curating and discovering wonderful things can find these
	Because every creator is also a broadcaster
Every curator is like an interior designer

Doesn't it seem like those days when you could buy "six albums for 1 cent" just
to be stuck in a contract with one of the big recording studios is back again,
just more inescapable?

We add aria tags to browsers to extend our XML based systems towards the multisensory
experience the internet will one day become;
The browser is window shopping.
Visiting a site and seeing endless ads for something you saw is intrusive and unwanted.

I may not succeed;
  but if I can, I will murder the browser.
